# Light-Curve-Clustering
This repository contains the work completed during a 7-week summer internship at the University of Kent focused on analyzing light curve variability data of young stars.

The goal was to develop a data analysis pipeline to apply dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to uncover insights within a dataset of over 3000 light curve fingerprints captured by the HOYS Citizen Project.
